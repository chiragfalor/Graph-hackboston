## Description
Subgraphs help in indexing massive datasets from blockchain contracts and expedite the querying of answers. We intended to make a subgraph that will be able to keep track of the number of transactions in a period of time. 

This has applications in the deploying of smart contracts. Apart from this, we anticipate potential applications in situations where blockchain is used to process high-speed transactions, such as during voting and in lotteries. 

Subgraphs would be extremely helpful for summarizing statistics of election results and much more effective than any other implementation. We have also added the github repo for our work on implementation of voting in blockchain for reference.

We have deployed this on the ethereum mainnet, Goerli, and the BCS network. We will continue working on implementing more non-trivial use of subgraphs given more time.
